        <h1>Elaine Suh</h1>
        <p class="title"> Hi! My name is Elaine Suh (she/her), I'm Korean American, and I'm a rising sophomore in high school. Also am a proud participant of GWC SIP, I joined to be a part of an environment of like-minded girls, where I can be seen and heard. I wanted to have the opportunity to do what I love best: learning and coding! I participate in and enjoy many things... I love to swim, run (long distance), and play tennis. I play the flute and am part of my high school debate team. I also like to read, listen to music, and bake. I enjoy playing Valorant and Minecraft as well! Hit me up, I love messages!</p>
