<h2 id="question"> What is Climate Change and why do we have to stop it? </h2> 
<br> </br>
   <p id="paragraph"> Climate Change, also known as <strong> global warming</strong>, is an alteration in global or regional weather patterns caused mainly because of human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. From the burning of about 35 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, to deforestation and unsustainable agriculture, climate change accelerates. The consequences are devastating.<br></br> As temperatures continue to rise, plant and animal species decline, contributing to the greater issue of biodiversity loss. As author for the National Geographic (2021), Sarah Gibbens points out, "The deadly heat waves, floods, and droughts that are upending the lives of thousands of people, from the American West to southern Europe and central China, will likely only get worse as global temperatures continue to rise, according to a sobering new report on the state of the worldâ€™s climate." 
   <br></br><strong>The list does not stop there. <br></br> We will soon feel climate change to the worst effects if we do not take action immediately. </strong></p>
